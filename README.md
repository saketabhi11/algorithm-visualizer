## 🌟 Core Features

✅ **Array Sorting Visualizer**  
> Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort — animated with live swaps and comparisons.

✅ **Linked List Visualizer**  
> Create, delete, and search nodes with real-time UI feedback.

✅ **Binary Tree Visualizer**  
> Watch In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order traversals unfold step-by-step.

✅ **Graph Visualizer**  
> Algorithms like BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra — beautifully animated with node transitions.

✅ **Step Controls**  
> Pause, play, change speed, and move step-by-step through the logic.

✅ **Responsive & Sleek UI**  
> Works perfectly on desktops and tablets, with modern design aesthetics.
